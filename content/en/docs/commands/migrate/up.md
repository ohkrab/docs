The `migrate up` command migrates all pending migration for a given migration set.

After successful migration its `version` is put into database migration table (by default `schema_migrations`).
At the beginning of an operation advisory lock is acquired to prevent other migrations to run simultaneously.

{{<alert icon="ðŸ’¡">}}
Migrations are executed in the order defined by migration set, NOT lexicographically.

When migration table does not exist, it will be created.
{{</alert>}}


## Usage

```bash
krab migrate up [set]
```

### Options

- `set` - name of the set to migrate.

## Example

For `default` [migration set]({{< ref "docs/configuration/resources/migration-set" >}}) you would use:

```bash
krab migrate up default
```
